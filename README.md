## Questions
  ### Why QT for the UI?

  When I created the gui for my game in Love, I had the problem of sorting my code, Libs like Slab or SUIT worked, but they were not  complete in my opinion, QT was more flexible for me, besides That I had already used it a while ago.

## Future implementations

* Add more character (I have them created, but I have to make the sprites)
* Better AI enemies
* Create more maps and complete actual map
* Better sprites (I know, it's ugly)
* Create sound
* Create a chat in-game
* Better ui design in the launcher
* Destructive terrain in-game
* Create a boss for each map
* Create a server to multiplayer
* Linux executable
